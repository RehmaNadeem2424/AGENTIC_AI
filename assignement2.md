#  Understanding Key API and Software Concepts

### 1. API
An *API* (Application Programming Interface) allows communication between software applications, defining rules for data exchange and functionality usage.

### 2. SDK
A *Software Development Kit (SDK)* is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to build software for specific platforms.

### 3. Web APIs
Web APIs are HTTP-based interfaces that enable applications to interact over the internet, such as retrieving or sending data from servers.

### 4. Library APIs
Library APIs provide pre-built functions and modules that simplify software development by offering reusable components.

### 5. Prompting and Completion
In Large Language Models (LLMs), *prompting* refers to providing an input query, while *completion* generates the output based on the given input.
