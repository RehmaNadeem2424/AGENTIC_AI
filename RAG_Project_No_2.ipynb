Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values, and queries, the queries, keys, and values are linearly projected h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk, and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys, and values, the attention function is performed in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values. These are then concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values.\\n\\nThe multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.\\n\\nThe formula for Multi-Head Attention is:\\n\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)WO\\n\\nwhere headi = Attention(QWQ_i, KWK_i, V WV_i)\\n\\nWQ_i ∈ Rdmodel×dk, WK_i ∈ Rdmodel×dk, WV_i ∈ Rdmodel×dv, and WO ∈ Rhdv×dmodel are the parameter matrices for the linear projections.\\n\\nIn the described work, h = 8 parallel attention layers (heads) are used. For each head, dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. The reduced dimension of each head keeps the total computational cost similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n'"
